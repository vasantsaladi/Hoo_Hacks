        You are a food waste management expert. Based on the following data from a restaurant or food service operation,

        - Food Type: {food_type}

        INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Provide exactly 6 specific, actionable recommendations

        3. Focus on practical solutions that can be implemented immediately or in the short term
        4. Tailor recommendations to the specific food type and waste amount
